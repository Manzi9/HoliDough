Major:
- change hardcoded currencies to get from api. Get from Jack's call after merge
- convert to controlled components
- only display submit button on successful form validation?
- use api for countries and add search on input
- Check if callback syntax is correct?

Minor: 
- Display total budget from store which auto-updates as user types to display remaining budget
- edit date format and number format before sending to store?
- abstract validation and move to separate file

later:
- Add auto-focus on load
- Add geolocation to autodetect home country?
- fix selected/defaultValue bug
- Date conversion?
