Onboarding:

- Holiday Dates
- Holiday Destination
- Budget

Start of with budget for the whole holiday. We start of with one trip.

Questions Russell:
-Use class to store data?
-If and how to display past and future expenses
-How to store passwords
-How to do multiple trips in state? Different branches or key and value for trip?

How does the daily budget work?

- Are the travel days included in the daily budget?
- Does the total budget include the hotel? See next question.
- How does the hotel work? Often gets paid in one bigger payment.
- I saw on the other site they have expenses before the holiday that you can add. e.g. hotel, flight.
- store the daily budget in the state with details? If yes, when to do this? At onboarding or later?

In my head it's like this:
Daily budget: $80.00
Spend today: $60.00
Left of todays budget: $20.00
Overall: -$30.00 --> don't know how to call this. It is what you have spend to much or left from the previous days on your daily budget.
